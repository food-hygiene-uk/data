The EHO who attended refused to accommodate our member of staff who is deaf, who requested the EHO wait for a colleague who could interpret for them. Many of the comments in our inspection are flagrantly false and had they waited 10 minutes or less for one of our team to be free they could have performed a proper inspection. We filed a formal complaint against the attending EHO for this act of ableism and have been seeking a response from Westminster Council - however as of 31/05/24 when our incorrect rating has been issued we have not had a response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\tOur staff have hygiene certificates, we have great practices in place that have been rated 5 stars in our other establishments, and we have not had any food safety incidents in our sites in over 5 years. We believe this rating is an example of the prejudice disabled workers face in the modern workplace and we hope we can encourage the council to deliver training to their team to prevent future discrimination.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\tWe are a new business and would seek to improve in all areas. At the time of attending one of our sinks was not draining properly, however the 4 other sinks in the establishment including the ones we use to wash our equipment, and the dishwasher, were working normally.
