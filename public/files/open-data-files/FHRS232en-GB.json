premises has been thoroughly cleaned and procedures are in place to ensure that cleanliness is maintained, The staff have been retrained&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\tThe conditions found at the time of the inspection were not typical of the normal conditions maintained at the establishment and arose because: Aprons not worn by food handlers - staff have been retrained in the importance of using the appropriate PPE. Cutting boards badly scored - 2 new cutting boards have been purchased as requested Frozen meat being defrosted at ambient temperature - staff have been retrained in how to defrost food correctly, by either placing in the fridge or placing in a sealed container and placing under cold running water. Cleaning products stored near foods - this comment relates to some clean and unused sponges that were near a unsealed bag of flour. At the time of the inspection, these were moved to a more appropriate place that the inspector approved of. Flooring underneath equipment dirty, legs to equipment dirty - these were cleaned immediately. As stated at the time of inspection, we do a deep clean once a week on a Sunday where things like the legs of equipment are attended to. Pipework dirty - relating to the pipework under the sink. These have been cleaned. Sink had food debris in it - at the time of the inspection we were quite busy. Staff have been reminded about the importance of cleaning as you go. Seals on fridges dirty - these have been cleaned. Inspector says they felt we were not working to our Safer Food Better Business pack - we always endeavour to follow all of the polices/procedures and advised methods as provided in the pack. We hope that the changes made reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;\n","LocalAuthorityCode":"232","LocalAuthorityName":"Norwich
