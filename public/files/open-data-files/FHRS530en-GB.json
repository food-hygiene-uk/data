The food kept in the hot holding unit was place shortly before the officer came to the shop,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\thence the food was unable to reach the minimum temperature required. I mentioned this to the&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\tofficer but she refused to accept this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\t6. The inspector stated on the paperwork that it was a counter top that was damaged but this is&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\tincorrect as it was a shelf in the back storage shelf that was broken. This shelf had a box in the&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\tshelf which was removed and take the photo.
